      <p>LITRA Telescopic Pool Covers are a quality product suitable for all seasons to protect your pool and be able to use it all year round.</p>
      <img style={{ width: 'auto', height: '500px' }} src="img/4.jpg" alt="Something went wrong..." />
      <p>Taking care of our outdoor space and swimming pool is a problem that everyone is forced to face sooner or later. Most people spend fortunes to have a swimming pool in their home or business (hotel, restaurant, sports centre). In the summer it turns out to be a great attraction for new customers or a great relaxation area for personal use while, in the cold seasons it becomes dead capital which, once the cold season has passed, will require maintenance before it can be used again.</p>
      <p>From today all this can be changed, the LITRA telescopic pool covers (mainly divided between Telescopic Pool Covers and isothermal pool covers) are special pool covers capable of protecting your pool and guaranteeing its use during all seasons of the year.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Telescopic Covers for Motorized Pools</p>
      <p>LITRA pool covers are telescopic covers for motorized pools (also available in manual version at the customer's discretion). The peculiarity of our covers is that they can be completely retracted during the hot seasons to make our customers or our family appreciate the heat of the sun while they are comfortably relaxed inside the pool. In winter, however, by closing the sliding pool covers it is possible to create an isolated (and therefore also heatable) environment to be able to continue using your pool even on rainy, snowy or windy days.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Differences between Telescopic Pool Covers and Isothermal Pool Covers</p>
      <p>The two types of swimming pool covers most used and appreciated in Italy and around the world are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Telescopic Pool Covers</li>
        <li>Isothermal Covers for Swimming Pools</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The main difference between these two types of swimming pool covers is the shape of the cover.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>Telescopic Pool Covers. Telescopic Design</p>
      <p>As the word itself suggests: "Telescopic Covers", this type of pool cover has a telescopic shape, i.e. it has an arch in the upper part of the cover which guarantees a classic and impeccable design.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '20px' }}>Isothermal Covers for Swimming Pools. Isometric Design</p>
      <p>Isothermal covers, on the other hand, are covers that have "irregular" shapes. There are no arches in the structure which appears more "rigid" than the telescopic one but which guarantees a unique and pleasing design to the eye.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Advantages of Telescopic Pool Covers</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drastic reduction in maintenance of water loss through evaporation and protection from wear caused by time and adverse climatic conditions (rain, wind, snow, hail and humidity);</li>
        <li>Safety and protection for your children;</li>
        <li>Constant water temperature, even during the night;</li>
