      <p>With LITRA Bioclimatic Pergolas you will be able to attract customers or friends and family all year round, increasing your turnover for a guaranteed return on investment in a short time. LITRA Motorized Bioclimatic Pergolas have the ability to regulate the internal microclimate by creating natural ventilation. Our Motorized Bioclimatic Covers are made up of adjustable aluminum slats. In the presence of sun, the slats can be retracted, improving air circulation and creating a natural aerodynamic flow that moves the hot air upwards. With our Bioclimatic Pergolas with rain, the slats can be closed with a simple click via remote control. The water is conveyed into the drainpipes integrated into the structure. Our technical innovations are perfectly integrated into the epoxy powder lacquered aluminum structure, characterized by a harmonious design, capable of enhancing any type of structure and enriching the aesthetics of the product. The motorization of the LITRA Bioclimatic Pergolas is controlled by a remote control which regulates the opening, the rotation up to 45Â° degrees, and an almost total opening so as to be able to regulate the light up to a total passage of the sun. The structures made of aluminum alloy; Insulated and resistant to atmospheric agents, the LITRA Bioclimatic pergola protects you from sun, rain, wind and even snow. A gasket is also provided along the internal perimeter which guarantees perfect thermal insulation from the external environment. Now Some Technical Details. Each slat, along its entire length, is equipped with a gasket on which the adjacent closing slat rests, guaranteeing impermeability to water and air. The LITRA Bioclimatic Pergolas are composed of a galvanized steel or lacquered aluminum structure and a retractable and adjustable cover with aluminum slats and thermal break. They are also motorized and operated by remote control. The profiles of the LITRA Bioclimatic Coverings, poles, guides, crosspieces, are designed for the installation of Side Closures such as Transparent Windows or Transparent Vertical Awnings which are made of epoxy lacquered aluminium, while the accessories are in marine lacquered die-cast aluminium.
