      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Motorized telescopic roofs and covers Milan, the best mobile covers only from LITRA</p>
      <p>The Milano LITRA covers, which also include our motorized telescopic roofs, are among the most popular telescopic covers in the last five years throughout the world and especially in America.</p>
      <img style={{ width: 'auto', height: '500px' }} src="img/3.jpg" alt="Something went wrong..." />
      <p>In recent years, even in our peninsula, some of the most renowned restaurants, hotels and nightclubs have begun to install this type of roofing in Milan. Often underestimated, aluminum outdoor covers, especially if retractable, provide those who install them with a new additional external (or internal) space where they can serve customers all year round. The real strengths of our Milan covers are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The possibility of being able to open or close our telescopic covers as you wish whenever you want and based on the weather conditions, in fact all it takes is a simple click on a button or our remote control.</li>
        <li>Their unique and innovative style can attract a large number of customers and increase the value of your business.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Resistance and elegance in our motorized Milano covers</p>
      <p>LITRA motorized Milano covers are built with a high quality painted aluminum structure that never rusts and is able to withstand winds of up to 150 km/h, while the material used for the cover can be chosen from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extremely resistant fabrics.</li>
        <li>PVC</li>
        <li>Polycarbonate</li>
        <li>Plexiglas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thanks to the quality of the materials used for the construction of our structures, we are able to guarantee our Milan roofing for five years. The retractable canopy system used for our motorized mobile covers is a LITRA patented system which guarantees durability and efficiency over time</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Why are our motorized mobile covers more useful than other covers?</p>
      <p>The answer to this question is simple. Imagine a hot summer day, a restaurant or hotel room full of customers and the internal temperature slowly rising, forcing you to turn on air conditioners, fans for air circulation and other expensive and electricity-consuming equipment. Instead, think now that you have installed one of our Milano covers, the solution in this case would be much simpler, you would just need to press a button, open your telescopic cover, and the room would start to cool down, guaranteeing much greater air recirculation than any fan beyond to offer your customers a unique spectacle, that of being able to observe the sky while sitting comfortably in your restaurant. For places particularly subject to strong sun and high temperatures it is recommended to install our Milano covers combined with one of our awnings to ensure maximum comfort.</p>
      <p>Our motorized telescopic covers are particularly recommended for some types of commercial activities such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Restaurants</li>
        <li>Hotels</li>
        <li>Bars</li>
        <li>Pub</li>
        <li>Nightclubs</li>
        <li>Sports Centers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thanks to their uniqueness (they are tailor-made for each customer) they adapt perfectly to every situation</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Our Telescopic Covering system</p>
      <p>Our telescopic covers are all movable covers (except at the express request of the customer) and this means that they are all equipped with our retractable roof system. The Milano covers are fixed for 1/3 of the length of their structure while for 2/3 of their structure they are retractable.</p>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>Other advantages of our telescopic roofs</p>  
      <p>Our telescopic roofs and coatings are designed and manufactured to avoid the unwanted phenomenon of condensation. Our facilities are also designed for the installation of heating and air conditioning systems. Our Telescopic Roofs offer excellent protection from wind, sun, humidity and noise. Milano LITRA roofs can also be equipped with an innovative snow melting system, this device serves to avoid the accumulation of snow on the roof and is therefore particularly suitable for areas with a high risk of snow.
