      <p>Our product is a revolutionary concept of terrace awnings, which allows you to use your outdoor space in any weather condition. Even on the hottest days of summer your patio is beautiful and comfortable, while in winter, an outdoor awning can truly transform your outdoor space into a truly beautiful and relaxing area.</p>
      <p>Our awnings for terraces or verandas are particularly suitable for managers and owners of:</p>
      <p>Restaurants and bars: Our awnings can help increase the number of tables. Outdoor spaces are often used to add extra tables to accommodate more customers, especially in summer. With our terrace awnings you can protect your space from the wind and create a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere</p>
      <p>Businesses: Our terrace awnings can be very useful for newsstands, shops, temporary exhibitions and other applications as they provide more space to display products. Structures and fabrics: All our structures are made of high-strength painted aluminum that never rusts. The fabrics used are guaranteed for 5 years, anti-moth and anti-mould treated.</p>
      <p>Our awnings are excellent quality products that can be customized in shape, colour, fabric design and choice of materials to meet your specific needs. Suitable for any type of home, they add style and character to your property (terraces and balconies) and your outdoor spaces (gardens, courtyards, clearings). They can provide color uniformity and building facades.</p>
      <p>Think of your outdoor space as an extension of your home! During the warm season our awning can increase your living space and transform your outdoor space into a lounge or living room. The shade and protected living space that the LITRA awning provides guarantees the possibility of living outdoors in all seasons, in a cool and comfortable environment, protected day and night, all year round. Our awnings are available with two different opening-closing systems: manual (with crank) or motorized.</p>
      <p>Our terrace awnings are characterized by high robustness and durability, which make them completely safe. All materials and components used for the production of our structures (aluminium, fabric, nuts, bolts, motors and so on) have been subjected to strict safety tests.</p>
      <p>All our structures are made of high-strength painted aluminum that never rusts. They can be completely dismantled and municipal authorization is not required.</p>
      <p>LITRA offers particularly favorable conditions for builders and condominiums who want to replace awnings install new structures on their balconies.</p>
