      <p>Surely, like us, many of you will have dreamed of being able to use your garden in all seasons. Until recently this was just a dream, today thanks to winter gardens it is no longer the case.</p>

      <p>The Winter Gardens are a product that allows anyone to enjoy their outdoor space all year round. Whether it's the garden of your home or a beautiful space in your restaurant, hotel, etc., you can now use it all year round.</p>
      <p>For winter gardens, LITRA uses its special mobile covers (manual or motorized), which allow you to retract the roof in summer, allowing you to fully enjoy the beauty of your garden without giving up protection during the cold seasons, in which it will be sufficient to extend the roof to have our beautiful winter garden.</p>
      <p>The winter garden covers made by LITRA are available in different types including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wooden winter gardens</li>
        <li>Aluminum winter gardens</li>
        <li>English style winter gardens</li>
      </ul>
      <p style={{ fontSize: '24px' }}>The quality of the LITRA Winter Gardens</p>
      <p>Like all LITRA products, winter gardens also guarantee protection from wind up to 150 km/h, rain, snow, hail, UV rays and other atmospheric conditions.</p>
      <p>To create our movable covers for winter gardens, LITRA uses quality materials capable of resisting over time. The most appreciated winter garden is the aluminum one, i.e. composed of an extremely resistant aluminum structure that never oxidizes (thanks to the special painting to which it is subjected) and covered with transparent material such as PVC, Plexiglas or Polycarbonate with a very similar to a veranda.</p>
      <p>English-style winter gardens are one of the latest innovations introduced on the peninsula and are also much appreciated by those who love a style that blends the classic and the modern.</p>
      <p>Wooden conservatories are the most classic yet timeless covering for winter gardens. The wooden structure guarantees a unique design capable of making your garden the true jewel of your home.</p>
      <p>It is possible to make your winter gardens a real habitable space (habitable winter gardens), thanks to the combination of our removable side closures with our winter garden covers. Those who choose this option can make their outdoor space a real additional room for their home. This solution is particularly recommended for those who love being in contact with nature. It is important to remember that those who choose to create habitable winter gardens can use our removable side closures to open their space again at any time by removing them.</p>
      <p>In fact, to guarantee maximum quality and usability, LITRA develops constructions capable of creating isolated environments but which are not considered permanent. This guarantees that our covers, including winter garden covers, are not subject to certain types of taxation (as they are not permanent) and can be easily dismantled in the event of relocation or additional work.</p>
