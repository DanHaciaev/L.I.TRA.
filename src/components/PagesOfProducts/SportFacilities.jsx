      <p>Thanks to the motorized retractable system with which our sports facility covers are equipped, you will have the possibility, simply by pressing a button, to protect the public from rain and snow, or you can use our covers for sports facilities on particularly hot days to offer a pleasant shaded area.</p>
      <p>The sports field covers made by LITRA offer high comfort to spectators throughout the year. Compared to traditional covers, in fact, motorized sports facility covers also make possible a natural recirculation of air if they are opened and this allows guests to breathe especially on humid and muggy days.</p>
      <p>To guarantee maximum quality and high durability, our covers for sports facilities are telescopic. Thanks to this shape it is possible to facilitate the drainage of water through the channels so as not to weigh down the structure. It is possible to choose our sports covers in two different types. The first is made up of 2 sections (one fixed and one retractable) which makes our sports facility covers openable up to 50% of its total length, the second type is instead made up of 3 sections (one fixed part and two mobile) which allows the opening of our cover up to 66% of its total length.</p>
      <p>Our roofs for sports facilities can be requested insulated or transparent, this mainly depends on the type of building and the needs of our customer. However, our experts will be able to advise you and guide you as best as possible in your choice, in case of doubts or questions.</p>
      <p>Only at LITRA will you find quality material, excellent prices, and support for your purchases. Request a free quote to transform your sports facility into a wonderful "arena" with our LITRA sports facility covers.</p>
