      <p>Most of our large roofs consist of: outdoor roofing for restaurants, roofing for bars, large roofing for hotels, roofing for shopping centres, roofing for escalators, roofing for airports, roofing for railway stations, ports and sports tensile structures.</p>
      <p>Our tensile structures and large outdoor covers have also been particularly appreciated abroad. In fact, LITRA roofing was used for the architectural restyle of the main French squares of Canet en Roussillon and La Grande Motte. For this occasion, LITRA has developed and supplied insulated telescopic covers made specifically for commercial activities such as: external covers for bars, covers for restaurants, hotels, banks, casinos and nightclubs.</p>
      <p>Thanks to our covers you can protect your outdoor space or create a new outdoor area that can be used for multiple uses. This is because our large outdoor covers and tensile structures offer protection from rain, strong winds (up to 150km/h), snow, UV rays and other weather conditions. Thanks to the special water drainage system with which our roofs are equipped, it will also be very simple to get rid of rainwater without causing damage to the landscape or surrounding buildings.</p>
      <p>The large outdoor covers and LITRA tensile structures are made following strict internal quality standards, which make our products a reliable and long-lasting product. In fact, they are made using extremely resistant and non-rusting painted aluminum for the structure while, as covering materials, we leave our customers the choice between very resistant anti-mold and waterproof fabrics, PVC, Polycarbonate or Plexiglas.</p>
      <p>The large outdoor covers and tensile structures, like all LITRA products, are tailor-made to the needs of the customer who, beyond the dimensions, can choose between a transparent cover or a classic cover. All LITRA covers are made by our staff with complete respect for the surrounding environment and are an effective way to beautify the urban context with style, elegance and functionality.</p>
