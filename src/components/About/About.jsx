      <p>After years of study, LITRA engineers have developed revolutionary intelligent telescopic roofing systems whose advantages far exceed traditional covers:
        <ul>
          <li>Motorized The revolutionary LITRA movable patio cover system makes it much easier to open and close the cover automatically at the touch of a button. Not everyone is capable of motorising large telescopic covers like ours.</li>
          <li>Retractable Our very innovative system of mobile terrace covers offers the possibility of choosing when you want to cover or when to enjoy the outdoors. And it allows you to have shade or enjoy the sun as you wish. The roof of our terrace covering is retractable for two thirds of the length while it is fixed for one third (66% retractable).</li>
          <li>Durable The telescopic covers, the Milan Verandas, the Milan Awnings and the other LITRA covers are built with top quality components. With an aluminum frame that never rusts (aluminum outdoor covers), painted with opposidic powders in two standard colours: brown and ivory, and furthermore for larger jobs you can choose different available colours.</li>
          <li>Waterproof Our telescopic covers are waterproof as they are equipped with water collection via side gutters, they are 100% waterproof and offer protection from various atmospheric agents.</li>
          <li>Insulated Comfort will be ensured with our telescopic covers equipped with an insulating mattress which allows you to create four-season coverage, an option for both cold and heat, for winter and summer which offers the possibility of living when weather and cold to warm with the help of a heating device, without heat loss.</li>
          <li>Anti-condensation One of the most important qualities, this is because condensation brings little hygiene. We have developed a multi-layer anti-condensation system that eliminates dripping to avoid the phenomenon of condensation. The anti-condensation system is included in the insulation system which absorbs it which is also why our roofs are cool in summer and dry in winter.</li>
          <li>Freshness Our telescopic roofing systems, thanks to our patented insulation, allow a temperature balance that helps reduce the internal temperature by 40% even in very hot weather conditions.</li>
          <li>Snow melting This is our supplementary system, an engineering concept designed to avoid problems caused by excessive snow loads. Thanks to this system, the snow will melt on the roof, thus avoiding accumulations of excessive load, time consuming to remove it and damage to our roofs.</li>
          <li>Soundproof The soundproofing of our covers occurs through materials used in aeronautics and special constructions. Our covers are made of multiple layers. Between the various layers there is a layer of lead which offers protection from noise and is ideal for discos, nightclubs, private homes, hotels and so on. With our fantastic closures you will feel the difference.</li>
          <li>Protection from UV rays Our covers provided with an insulated system are much healthier offering a regenerating well-being by providing shade and preventing the sun's rays from penetrating the material.</li>
          <li>Windproof The aluminum structure of our roofing systems for open spaces is made by us and is highly wind-resistant.</li>
          <li>Anti-seismic With our patio or terrace closures you will be more than safe and without ever worrying about the structure collapsing. It is not a standard feature but LITRA is able to build a structure that resists medium intensity earthquakes.</li>
          <li>Anti-hurricane With our structures your business continues as if nothing had happened. Our roofs resist hurricanes up to category three intensity and successfully face this test.</li>
          <li>Side Panels Our covers include sliding and removable panels that do not create volume, one of the secrets for which LITRA almost always obtains permits to install roofing systems. Our side closures are completely removable and offer the possibility of installing the panels in the winter and removing them in the summer. Thus you will have a very versatile and elegant covering suitable for all four seasons and furthermore with our side closures it is also possible to build sliding doors, which are easily removable.</li>
          <li>Decoration Aesthetics is the most important feature of an outdoor cover today, that's why the inside and outside of our covers can be decorated in different colors to elegantly embellish the place where you live and will help create a unique environment.</li>
          <li>Transparent Our telescopic covers and our verandas are suitable for all types of climate. Often used to create the so-called outdoor feeling (being indoors while still having a view of the outside), they offer you the opportunity to enjoy the beauty of a day whether in winter or summer, with the sensation of being outdoors , guaranteeing you the protection of your home. Our clear outdoor covers allow views of the sky both day and night.</li>
        </ul>
